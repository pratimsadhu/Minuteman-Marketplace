                        I’m a junior Computer Science major at UMass Amherst,
                        and I’m excited to learn more about software and web
                        development, and apply what I’ve learned to this project
                        from previous courses. Aside from studying computer
                        science, I enjoy cooking and staying physically active!

                    <p>
                        I'm a senior at UMass Amherst studying Computer Science,
                        deeply into all things tech and coding. When I'm not
                        buried in lines of code, you can find me at the table
                        tennis table, smashing away stress and having a great
                        time. It's this blend of geeking out on computers and my
                        love for a fast-paced game that keeps me balanced.
                        Whether it's acing a project or a serve, I'm all about
                        having fun and taking on challenges with a smile.

                        Hey there, I'm Shalom, a tech enthusiast with a passion
                        for turning ideas into reality. Whether I'm crafting
                        predictive models with machine learning, fine-tuning
                        images with computer vision techniques, or unraveling
                        the mysteries of cybersecurity, I'm all about pushing
                        the boundaries of what's possible. With a versatile
                        arsenal of programming languages including Python,
                        C/C++, Java, and JavaScript, complemented by an array of
                        powerful libraries like NumPy, Scikit-learn, and pandas,
                        I'm fully equipped to breathe life into abstract
                        concepts, turning them into concrete realities. Let's
                        team up and embark on an exciting journey of innovation!

                        I'm super excited to bring my software development mojo
                        to the table for this project. From Python to Java,
                        JavaScript, and beyond, I've dabbled in a bunch of
                        languages. And let's not forget about React.js and Flask
                        – they've been my go-to for building cool web stuff. Oh,
                        and Git and GitHub? Can't live without 'em – they've
                        been my trusty sidekicks for keeping my code organized
                        and collaborating with teammates.
