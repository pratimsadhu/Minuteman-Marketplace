# CS 326 Semester Project

## Project Overview

For our CS 326 semester project, our group members initially worked individually on our own pages, which can be found in the HTML subdirectory of the client directory. Each member focused on creating their respective pages with the necessary functionality and design elements.

## Combining Pages

After completing our individual pages, we collaborated to combine them into a single-page application. This consolidation process involved integrating our separate HTML pages into the index.html file, ensuring seamless navigation and functionality across the entire application. We decided to keep the different pages in their respective directories as well, as it was a good show of progress.

## Accessing Milestone-02

To access the milestone-02 content, please run `npm run milestone-02`. While running `npm run milestone-02`, if a directory shows up, simply go to the client directory and the application should load.
